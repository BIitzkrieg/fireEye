 # hx-menu
 Simple hacky menu script to interface with hx-cmd. Reads in a list of hosts to preform mutliple actions on.
 
 # hx-cmd
 Customized hx-cmd script by Henrik Olsson of Fire Eye. Fixed the approve containment function. Also added functionality to get containment status, and stop containment of hosts. Needs his hx_lib library to function.
